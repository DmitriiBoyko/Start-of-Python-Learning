# About. My Name is Dmitry Boyko, and I'm webflow developer from Kyiv, Ukraine. I am 45 years old and I have been looking towards the Data Analyst profession for a long time, and today I decided to start studying Data Analytics.
Of course, I divided the training into several parts, namely:
<li>Python</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>PowerBi</li>
<P>
In my opinion, my English also requires many hours of training, so I try to complete all training in English, although sometimes this is not very comfortable, especially when there are a lot of specifics.
The main problem in training is the lack of a mentor, a logically structured learning system, systematized knowledge, since I want to learn everything on my own, rather than in courses, respectively, without information from completely different sources, I filter, analyze, select and study what seems correct to me at the moment.
Considering what I had already learned, I decided that keeping a record of everything that happened on GitHov would be a good idea.
